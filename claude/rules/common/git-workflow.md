# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Multi-Machine Sync

- Always commit and push when finishing a task
- Pull/rebase before pushing if upstream changes exist
- If push fails (diverged), stop and ask how to resolve
